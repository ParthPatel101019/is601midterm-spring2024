#### Advanced Python Calculator for Midterm Project

### Project Overview

  The Calculator App is a Python command-line application designed for performing arithmetic operations and managing calculation history. It demonstrates best practices in application architecture, employing design patterns, dynamic loading, and comprehensive logging.

### Core Features

  - Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
  - History Management: Utilizes Pandas for robust management of calculation history, allowing users to view, save, load, clear, and delete history records.
  - Plugin System: Features a flexible plugin system that dynamically loads additional functionalities at runtime, enhancing the app's extensibility without modifying the core codebase.
  - Logging: Implements detailed logging of application operations, errors, and informational messages, with log severity levels and dynamic configuration through environment variables.

### Project Structure

  The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- app/: Contains the core application logic, including commands, plugins, and utilities.
- commands/: Defines individual command classes for arithmetic operations.
- plugins/: Houses plugins like the history manager for additional functionalities.
- command.py: Implements the Command pattern and a command handler for managing command executions.
- mylogging.py: Configures and provides a centralized logging mechanism.
- logs/: Directory for storing log files generated by the application.
- env: Stores configuration settings as environment variables for easy modification.
- main.py: Serves as the entry point of the application.

### Installaion

  1)Clone the repository or download the project to your local machine.
  2)Ensure Python 3.x is installed: The application requires Python 3.x. Verify with python --version or python3 --version.
  3)Install dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install required packages.

### Usage

  1)Start the Application: Navigate to the project root directory and run python main.py to start the application.
  2)Enter Commands: Use the command-line interface to perform operations. For example:
  - To add two numbers: add 5 3
  - To view calculation history: history view

### Commands
  - add <num1> <num2>: Adds two numbers.
  - subtract <num1> <num2>: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - multiply <num1> <num2>: Multiplies two numbers.
  - divide <num1> <num2>: Divides the first number by the second.
  - history view: Displays the calculation history.
  - history clear: Clears the calculation history.

### Instruction

  1)Use the code to start the program
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```
  2)For operation
  ```bash
  operation operand1 operand 2
  ```
  3)For History
  ```bash
  History #For viewing History
  History view #For viewing History
  History clear #For clearing History
  ```

### Environment Variables and Configuration

  Use the following code in .env file . This will create a file name calculator_app log
  ```bash
  LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
  LOG_FILE=calculator_app.log
  ```

### History Management

  The CalculationHistoryManager in app/calculation_history_manager.py handles all history-related functionalities.
  Operations are automatically logged. Use history commands to interact with these records.

### Advanced Data Handling with Pandas

Employ Pandas for:
- Efficient data reading and writing to CSV files.
- Managing calculation history.

### Design Patterns for Scalable Architecture

Incorporate key design patterns to address software design challenges, including:
- **Facade Pattern:** Offer a simplified interface for complex Pandas data manipulations.
- **Command Pattern:** Structure commands within the REPL for effective calculation and history management.
- **Factory Method, Singleton, and Strategy Patterns:** Further enhance the application's code structure, flexibility, and scalability.
